                My name is Brad and I am a 3rd year Digital arts student at Wits. For someone not doing environmental studies or something, it might be odd to see me make a website focused on climate chance.

                Well, Climate change awareness is a cause I hold dearly, and it frustrates me to see what little effort global corporations, which can fully take the blame for the state of the planet, and global governments make in order to undo, or at least mitigate the effects of climate change. A scary notion is the idea that this is not the worst to come. The Earth already experiences some of the most intense weather events, with meteorologist predicting a worsening of these events. Weather events that will effect the poorer folk than the top 1%.

                A won't let this turn into  a rant, so I'll leave you with this. 
                Elon musk, as well as other insufferable billionaires, still make big announcements about their plans to colonize Mars, a planet that literally doesn't have an atmosphere by the way, when there's a perfectly good planet right under their feet worth saving.

                I drew all the backgrounds for the website.
