            This blue marble floating in the endless abyss has been around for an estimated 4.45 billion years, give or take 50 million years, as stated in this <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/age-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Geographic article</a>. Interestingly enough, the Earth is no stranger to a mass extinction event. In the Earthâ€™s lengthy history. It has seen 5 full mass extinction events. The most famous being the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era.

            All 5 mass extinction events the planet has experienced thus far have been brought about by unpredictable weather changes, or by cosmic annihilation at the hands of giant rocks crashing into the planet. This is not currently the case for us.

            The Earth is experiencing an event like no other. A mass extinction event cause by human activity. A notible culprit accelerating this event is climate change. The <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/age-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Nations</a> defines climate change as the long term shift in temperatures an weather patters. They further stat that these changes can occur naturally, but since the turn of the 1800s, human activity has become the main contributor to climate change. Primarily from burning fossil fuels, and releasing Greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.
